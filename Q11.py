# Create a variable, filename. Assuming that it has a three-letter
# extension, and using slice operations, find the extension. For
# README.txt, the extension should be txt. Write code using slice
# operations that will give the name without the extension. Does your
# code work on filename of arbitrary length?

for i in range(len(filename)):

        print("The extension of the filename is:", filename[i+1:])
